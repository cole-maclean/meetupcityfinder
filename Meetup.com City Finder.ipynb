    "<h1>Introduction</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in February of this year, I packed up my comfortable Canadian life in Calgary, Alberta and moved to Barcelona, Spain to obtain an education in the Mediterranean lifestyle, European cultures, un poco espa√±ol and some Artificial Intelligence. Having never moved to a new country on my own before, I was overwhelmed by the diverse languages and cultures of Barcelona, and for the first time, I felt truely lonely. With so many cool things to explore and experience in my new city, it took longer than I anticipated to find a group of people to share those experiences with. I realized that making new friends in your mid-twenties isn't quite the same as it was back on the playground, so I began to break out of my comfort zone by using [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) to attend events I found interesting. It's been a fantastic application for finding new friends and helping me settle into my new life in Barcelona.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meetup.com provides a platform for anybody to build a community around a topic of interest, scheduling events from casual drinks in a bar, hikes in the mountains or performing in a singing group. With meetup.com, you can \"Find your people\" by sharing your interests with others in your local community. This platform provides an interesting opportunity to explore which world cities have the most active users for any given topic, allowing us to find our ideal cities and perhaps learn a little about different cultures around the world. Fortunately, meetup.com provides a robust [API](http://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/) to allow us to explore this dataset for ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>The Final Visualization</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to build an interface to allow the user to explore various topics of interest and visualize the best cities for that unique grouping of topics. I've used my hometown of Calgary in the below example image with data science and spanish language as topics. The final visualization can be viewed [here.](https://cole-maclean.github.io/meetupcityfinder/) Feel free to go play with it, the rest of this post outlines how to retrieve the data from meetup.com using it's API.\n",

    "<h2>Meetup.com API</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Meetup.com has a very well documented API, and memebers of the community have built API wrappers for many popular programming languages. Python being my language of choice, I've utilized the Python [meetup-api](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/meetup-api/) library for this project. To use the package, we first need to obtain an [API key](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/) to be used as authentication for our client object. "

The results past New York become more interesting for my example, especially Sydney. It does well in all of the topics that interest me, plus it ranks first in the category \"fun fun fun\".
